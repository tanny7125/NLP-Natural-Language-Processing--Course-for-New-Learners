Korg (Waititi), and Jane Foster (Portman)—who is now the Mighty Thor—to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) from eliminating all gods.

Exercise2:

Spacy default implementation considers "not" as a stop word. But in some scenarios removing 'not' will completely change the meaning of the statement/text. For Example, consider these two statements:

- this is a good movie       ----> Positive Statement
- this is not a good movie   ----> Negative Statement

So, after applying stopwords to those 2 texts, both will return "good movie" and does not respect the polarity/sentiments of text.

Now, your task is to remove this stop word "not" in spaCy and help in distinguishing the texts.

Hint: GOOGLE IT! Google is your friend.

#use this pre-processing function to pass the text and to remove all the stop words and finally get the cleaned form
def preprocess(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    no_stop_words = [token.text for token in doc if not token.is_stop]
    return " ".join(no_stop_words)       


#Step1: remove the stopword 'not' in spacy



#step2: send the two texts given above into the pre-process function and store the transformed texts



#step3: finally print those 2 transformed texts
