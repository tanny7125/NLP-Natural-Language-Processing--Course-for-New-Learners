Bag of n_grams: Exercise
Fake news refers to misinformation or disinformation in the country which is spread through word of mouth and more recently through digital communication such as What's app messages, social media posts, etc.

Fake news spreads faster than Real news and creates problems and fear among groups and in society.

We are going to address these problems using classical NLP techniques and going to classify whether a given message/ text is Real or Fake Message.

You will use a Bag of n-grams to pre-process the text and apply different classification algorithms.

Sklearn CountVectorizer has the inbuilt implementations for Bag of Words.
